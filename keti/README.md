# Audio, video and data channel server

This example illustrates establishing audio, video and a data channel with a
browser. It also performs some image processing on the video frames using
OpenCV.

The browser will send the audio and video from its webcam to the server.

The server will play a pre-recorded audio clip and send the received video back to the browser, optionally applying a transform to it.

In parallel to media streams, the browser sends a 'ping' message over the data channel, and the server replies with 'pong'.

## Installation

### Ubuntu 20.04

```bash
sudo apt install python3-pip
pip3 install --upgrade pip
sudo apt install python3-opencv
sudo apt install ffmpeg
```

### Windows 10

- Installation of Visual Studio Development with c++ is required
- FFmpeg install (https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/)
  - For Windows, add FFmpeg to Windows path using Environment variables

### VENV
```bash
sudo apt install python3.8-venv
```
Go to the keti directory.
```bash
python3 -m venv keti-env
source ./keti-env/bin/activate
```

### Running

First install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

When you start the example, it will create an HTTP server which you
can connect to from your browser:

```bash
python3 server.py
```

You can then browse to the following page with your browser:
http://127.0.0.1:20080

## API settings
